Atm Nsure is only a 2.5m cap. <br><br>With Nsure\u2019s new innovative model its likely going to be bigger than $NXM. <br><br>- What is Nsure?<br><br>Nsure is an open insurance platform for Open Finance. The project borrows the idea of Lloyd\u2019s London, a market place to trade insurance risks, where premiums are determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model. Capital mining will be implemented to secure capital required to back the risks at any point of time. A 3-phase crowd voting mechanism is used to ensure every claim is handled professionally.<br><br>- 2m cap<br><br>- Big VC\u2019s invested<br><br>- Recently got a W3F foundation grant (going to be integrated by Polkadot)<br><br>- To be integrated into multiple platforms<br><br>- Launching staking soon<br><br>If you stake your Nsure as an underwriter, you get 50% of every premium paid for coverage in that pool.<br><br>- Nsure burning mechanism <br><br>If a product goes through a successful claim, 50% of the tokens deposited in that specific product by underwriters are burnt.<br><br>- Listed on Uniswap, Bixmax, Gateio, likely to get listed on Huobi (Huobi is following Nsure) or Binance<br><br>- 0 Inflation for the next 3 months <br><br>- Only competitor is $NXM in a future trillion dollar industry<br><br>Website: https://h5.nsure.network/#/<br><br>Coingecko:<br>https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/<wbr>nsure-network",
