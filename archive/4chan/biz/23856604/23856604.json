Everything is in circles, where is something fails somewhere, you simply go other way round. Pretty much simple, there are also more complicated lines, like shape of stars and triangles, but logic is the same, if something fails, you disconnect that part and go way around. <br>Now tell me, dear OP, wouldn&#039;t they do the same with optics? huh? Yes, there are main lines who handle most of the traffic, but in case of failure you just redirect shit other pipes around. Very simple, OP. <br>Have you thought about that, you dumb dumb. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh solar winds down satellites, no electricity, no btc then</span><br>You will think about how to not get cancer from solar radiation first instead of playing fortnight on your dad&#039;s PC.",
