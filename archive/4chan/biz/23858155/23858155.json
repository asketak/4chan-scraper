I don&#039;t blame you so let me get you up to speed. Most importantly, Bitcoin isn&#039;t being espoused as a currency (that&#039;s only icing on the cake. Based on all the metrics we&#039;ve seen people don&#039;t exchange with it, they hodl it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;currency</span><br>Bitcoin will be used via PayPal/other applications soon as a currency if people really want to, but again, people like hodling it. Otherwise if they really want to use the blockchain, they can - a couple minutes and a ~5 fee. This is infinitely more pragmatic than carrying around a little satchel of gold coins around your waist to use gold as a means of exchange. Bitcoin is easily divisible, this simple fact defeats gold as a currency - it&#039;s a no contest.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;privacy</span><br>99.999999% of transactions don&#039;t need to be in an alleyway. Use Monero. The &quot;privacy&quot; narrative is dead at this point, nobody cares. Also, if you want privacy you can buy Bitcoin at ATM&#039;s where you don&#039;t have to give your ID, this means you can probably get away with never paying taxes too, which will save you money, but these ATMs have funny exchange rates.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Energy</span><br>The mostly cheap and sustainable hydro-electric energy it consumes is a negligible price to pay for a decentralized, borderless, sleepless, trustless, programmable store of value. Moving gold around en masse requires massive wastes of energy as well.<br><br>Burglary/Torture<br>Gold is much more easy to steal than bitcoin in a burglary - this is just based on the size implications (a hardware wallet/piece of paper is much easier to hide) and you can hide it in many more types of places, AND in different ways (book cyphers, etc). Also with multisig, you can create withdrawal rules, cool huh? If someone is torturing you, I would tell them where the gold was but not the Bitcoin, lol. <br><br>1/2",

More exchanges are being built with higher restrictions and regulations. This is why you are seeing the exchanges being shook up now, BTC is being legitimized. This means you can hodl on an exchange (your grandma doesn&#039;t need a hardware wallet). We&#039;ve come a long way from MtGox, yet I always recommend people storing mostly via hardware wallets - a child can do it. &quot;Hardware failures&quot;, even if your Trezor is destroyed somehow, you have the seed phrase backed up with hardware wallets - which means you need the hardware wallet AND your seed phrase to be destroyed. Practically speaking this is only possible in a fire, so act accordingly.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Controlled by Blockstream and the banks. Would lead to a tyrannical technocracy.</span><br>It&#039;s not controlled by anyone. Even simple code updates are damn near impossible to implement (which is great IMO). That&#039;s why Ethereum fans laugh at us with their constant dev work, that&#039;s okay, we don&#039;t mind. Tyrannical technocracy? I&#039;m not sure where you heard this, but the beautiful thing is, this is the first time in human history where retail is allowed to frontrun something before institutional wealth. I pity you if you eventually buy in after all of them eventually pile in.<br><br>I&#039;ll brush over gold quickly. But as I said earlier, you&#039;re thinking the wrong way about Bitcoin. And gold will never be used again as a currency, it&#039;s absurd. Large transactions with gold are impractical, anything can be stored in a swiss vault for safety. As for moving back to the gold standard, doubt it. But doesn&#039;t stop BTC from eating up its market cap. Gold inflates around 2% by miners, every time you hear about some new gold discovery, they are literally bleeding out your gold. They are like leeches sucking the purchasing power out of your gold. Your % of all the worlds gold is constantly being diminished, over years quite rapidly. Whereas with Bitcoin you always hold the same %, forever. Unprecedented.",
