This means that if an individual has enough money, he/she can effectively purchase all the voting rights. This accumulation of voting power would grant too much authority to a single organisation, creating a massive gap for any investment body to exploit the governance in exchange for money.<br>SpiderDAO fights against these faults by separating the governance token from voting rights. Instead, SpiderDAO requires users to have a compatible Spider Router installed and stake SPDR governance tokens in order to receive voting rights. One Spider Router installed would equate to 1 voting rights. SPDR token would be used for utility purposes. Moreover, SPDR tokens can be used for \u201cliquidity as utility\u201d services and liquidity mining - quite similar to the DeFi model.",
