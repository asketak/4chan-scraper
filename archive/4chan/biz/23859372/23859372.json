Bitcoin is not easily replaceable because of the network effect.<br><br>People think bitcoin can be replaced like facebook replaced myspace. It doesn\u2019t work like that the bitcoin network is enormous and decentralized. To build something like that from zero and invest to have the brand recognition bitcoin has would be insane.<br><br>Plus bitcoin is actually the best crypto because it is simple. Initially people thought it would be paypal 2.0 but no. It\u2019s actually digital gold. It\u2019s not a meme. And just like gold. Once it got going there\u2019s no turning back until a better gold emerges.<br><br>Bitcoin has value because it is actually conceptually the best money ever invented that actually took off. At this point every day that goes by it becomes less and less likely bitcoin will disappear and more likely it will stay for the long term. IMHO bitcoin is already sucking up value like a black hole sucks matter. Once people get it and big money pours in it will pour faster and faster which will make it better and better.<br><br>Eventually bitcoin will be the worlds largest asset and will underpin the global economy ironically though it will probably be sorta separate from the economy kinda like the economy are planets revolving around the bitcoin sun.<br><br>This will allow for an explosion of economic diversity and innovation and tokenization. Currencies will be able to be created with purpose and function in mind like we never dreamed of before. All made possible by Bitcoin. By simply existing as a mathematical and automatic predictive and reliable store of value",
