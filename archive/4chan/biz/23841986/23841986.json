It has no earnings and no use-case, so it must fall without the simple fever of speculation. But at a certain point, people are going to see that NEM (say) is far more likely to go from a $50 billion to a $100 billion mcap than that BTC will go from a $300 billion to a $600 billion mcap; plus NEM has a 13 P. E. ratio, pays excellent dividends, and offers the same alleged protection against inflation that BTC does. Better opportunities will entice people away from the BTC bubble out of necessity once it reaches a certain point, and that point is coming soon. Then it will collapse in upon itself at a rapid pace. The process will be vastly expedited by tether, because tether will collapse once BTC collapses and then cause BTC to collapse even further in its turn. (Deso explains why in the second of these two videos. <a href=\"#p23842603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;23842603</a>) If by some miracle BTC keeps going until the coming reset happens and the dollar gets dumped, and Russia and China announce new gold-backed currencies, then BTC&#039;s value will disappear overnight, because it has no value when priced in gold, only when priced in fiat.",

Bitcoin\u2019s value comes 100% from individuals who have freely decided to use it to store their wealth. <br>Bitcoin is a pure financial asset unlike gold which as you mentioned has other uses. But, the uses gold has are minor compared to its role as a financial asset. If gold were to suddenly lose its financial status its value would plummet as it became some bulk commodity like nickel or copper.<br>Fees and transaction times are a problem for bitcoin. A temporary problem. The lightning network, wrapped bitcoins that trade on faster chains, or an entirely different more advanced crypto. There are many solutions that are up to the free market to pick. In this regard it\u2019s better to consider crypto as a whole versus gold instead of bitcoin vs gold. <br>You say the miners can increase the maximum bitcoin supply. This is false. Miners can fork the chain with a new cap but the coin in that new chain will not be bitcoin and bitcoin\u2019s original chain would be left unharmed. This has happened multiple times already. <br>As for NEM, it\u2019s a company not a commodity which leaves it at risk of all human failings.

You&#039;re the same kind of person that thinks investing in a pump and dump coin is better than Bitcoin because some of them outperform it but in the end lose everything due to gambling. Yeah you make more money with low cap coins because if people follow your bet you make money by the cap going up. But if you lose that bet you just lose money. YFI and DeFi hype was everything you times 100. Coulda made a lot of money there too if you invested in that. Could lost a lot of money there. Crypto can do everything Boomer rocks do but better, faster and with more gains. <br>Bitcoin is the safe option of crypto. Your argument with market cap is an argument why Bitcoin is precisely the best choice to invest in. It&#039;s the safest bet and it reached a size where sudden swings downward don&#039;t happen anymore. And it grows more stable with the market cap growing. When Bitcoin reaches the market cap of Gold, the true asset you need to compare Bitcoin, too, not some fringe low cap company, that&#039;s the equivalent of some DeFi Token, a single Bitcoin will have roughly the value of 500,000 Dollar. And it doesn&#039;t stop there.<br>Replacing Gold isn&#039;t even Bitcoin&#039;s end goal. Any asset that can be considered a store of value like real estate, other PMGs, life insurance, bonds or whatever will find they will have to fight with BTC, an asset that is secure, needs no middle man, can be transferred, divided, stored anywhere and can be used in every country in the world",

Look at Venezuela. Even at the it&#039;s most volatile, Bitcoin was a more stable currency than the Venezuelan Bolivar. People in Venezuela will always use Bitcoin over the Bolivar of they are able too. The thing Peter Schiff and the Boomers that follow him don&#039;t understand is that Bitcoin isn&#039;t bought because it&#039;s a speculative asset like Gold where people buy it only because they know someone else is gonna buy it for that price too. Sure it&#039;s. A major factor in driving the price to crazy heights, but the underlying value from Bitcoin is the universal accessibility no matter how corrupt or broken or communist your country is. It will always be used as a currency as long as there is a Fiat currency worse than it. And one by one Bitcoin will eat one currency after another, Euros and Dollars are just the last in that line. It&#039;s why it&#039;s so hard for a western Boomer to understand why someone would use Bitcoin over their current currency",

There&#039;s no value to seize. As a matter of fact it does get seized when you attempt to cash it out for fiat, which is the only way in which you can make substantial use of it in the real world. Gold can be transferred anywhere as well, whether by means of a gold-backed crypto or gold-backed paper currencies, as explained in an earlier post. And as Switzerland wasn&#039;t even invaded during WW2, upholds the rule of law, and has never confiscated gold, anybody who holds gold in a Swiss vault can feel assured that their money is safe from seizure.",
