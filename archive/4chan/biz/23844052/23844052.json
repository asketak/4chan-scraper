I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m fully prepared for it but I&#039;m excited that, for better or worse, MASSIVE changes are coming to this world that will change how humans function for the foreseeable future. Geopolitical, socio-cultural, financial....everything will be altered. Whether it&#039;s for the benefit of mankind or it&#039;s enslavement is the only question. I pray we see the former and not the latter; it all depends on who holds the keys that determines where we as a species wind up going.",

Someone posted a link here to 10 part documentary few days ago, I watched it. It was made in a very silly way and clearly by older lady who calls herself patriot and probably makes Q WG1WGA posters. All in all Q people are pretty cringeworthy, just like 90% of XRP holders. Anyway, I knew everything from that documentary and everything is true. Can you imagine any different way that could redpill army or literal boomers? I don\u2019t. If you shove so much info right in peoples faces, most of them wouldn\u2019t believe it. Q movement has a lot of different problems and it may be psyop to keep people thinking that swamp is being drained while liberals destroy our society. Who knows, but they\u2019re not retards.",

This I believe to be the core root problem of humanity. The natural ingrained differences of humanity that cause some to feel as if they lacked enough to be considered unworthy, ultimately causes those who are steering towards evil tendencies to double down on their feelings, because ultimately, good people proved them right. You see, people who are intelligent, are a &quot;separate breed&quot; so to speak, and this is further exacerbated when you add a key characteristic that modern psychology would like to call sociopathy/psychopathy. These people are the &quot;key exceptional&quot; individuals for being able to take advantage of those not close in intellect and linguistic ability/interpersonal manipulative intelligence. ......",

If you are blessed in any of these qualities, and many others of course, and have ever even looked at anyone with negativity that lacked what you have, you ever so slightly inclined them to dislike you. Do this enough to the same person, a person already not standing on a sound foundation, and this is how evil is manifest in the human heart, and perpetuated, by the promotion of inequality, division, by those who are too proud of the gifts life gave them to be inclusive of those who are not as great as they.<br><br>So to all the people who have found themselves a part of the 17 movement, even if just by studying and informing yourself.

Well, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve counted, but whatever that number is, it is equal to the amount of times you knowingly or unknowingly caused negativity to fall on another instead of helping them avoid it. Rejoice in that a new world approaches where the autonomous revolution paired with the economic paradigm shifts will help empower the individual so that the collective can be strong once more by being less fractured than we are today. But this blessing is also a curse if you are unwilling to do as I have said, because now, in time, you will not be able to blame the clown circus upside down world the evildoers of the past had created where this very concept was promoted at all costs...&quot;From the debasing to the angelic.... we cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat.&quot;<br><br>TLDR, don&#039;t be selfish and share all that you have freely ASAP as well as help all the people who lack in something you have a lot of. Fail at this, and evil will invariably come back, and the very existence of good people will have manifested it unknowingly out of sight, yet again until they blindside the world. This is the most important lesson you will ever teach your kids.",
